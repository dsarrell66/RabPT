## RabPT - A Ruby Ray- and bidirectional Path-Tracer
+ A collection of various physical phenomenon rendering approaches, following basic ray-tracing approaches, implemented as a ruby application.

### run this application:
1. bundle
2. ruby rabpt.rb


### Debugging within the code
Place a ```` binding.pry ```` statement in w/e code region

### Run a specific test
```` rspec tests/my_model_spec.rb ````

### Milestone1
Implement a debug-ray tracer which can render a simple scene consisting of a pinhole camera, simple csg_solid objects, point-lights - relying on an appriximative sampling strategy (one-samples).
